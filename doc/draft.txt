Connect()
- does not set USER TIMEOUT. Not used in this implementation.
- int tcb we don't keep track of send window, send urgent pointer info (urgent pointer not supported, window is one)

in write()
- adding to queue will always succeed, so will never show error "insufficient resources"

in read()
- no need to notify user of urgent data or to mark push (both not supported)



in onSegmentArrive()
- no need to handle state == CLOSED because we don't support reset
- in state == LISTEN no need to check for reset
-

general:
- no need to implement abort call; not supported
- no security implemented
- precedence not check as window is max size of one packet
