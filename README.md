Comuter-Networks-Practical
==========================

The exercise consists of implementing a library for connection-oriented network service and a small application which uses this library.

This practicum consists of twp parts. The first is to build a TCP implementation for Android
smartphones. The second is to develop a Chat application over the TCP stack of the first part.
Both parts are to be written in Java using the Android operating system. Other languages and
operating systems are not permitted. Working alone is permitted, but working in groups of more
than two is not permitted.

The exercise consists of implementing a library for connection-oriented network service and
a small application which uses this library. This service is a simplified version of TCP on top
of IP as described below.
